1. Implement a PySpark script to handle any missing values and scale numerical features.
2. Develop a PySpark script that uses the K-means algorithm to cluster data points.
3. Develop a PySpark script that labels data points as anomalies based on their cluster 
assignments.
4. Implement code to evaluate the effectiveness of the K-means clustering model in detecting 
anomalies.
