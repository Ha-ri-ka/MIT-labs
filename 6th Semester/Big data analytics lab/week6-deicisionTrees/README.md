1)Demonstrate how to load a dataset suitable for prediction into a PySpark DataFrame and 
Display basic statistics and information about the dataset.

2)Implement a PySpark script to handle missing values and categorical features in the 
dataset.

3) Develop a PySpark script that trains a decision tree model on the training dataset.
   
4)Implement code to evaluate the decision tree model using metrics such as accuracy, 
precision, and recall.
