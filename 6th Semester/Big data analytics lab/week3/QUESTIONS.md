1) Develop a PySpark script to clean and preprocess data before performing entity resolution. 
Include steps like tokenization and normalization.

2) Implement a PySpark program that computes similarity scores between records using a 
chosen similarity metric.

3) Implement a PySpark program to evaluate the precision, recall, and F1-score of an entity 
resolution model.
